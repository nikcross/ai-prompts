Prompt Template — Repository Prompt Style Audit
===============================================

Purpose
-------
Run this prompt when you need an AI assistant to verify that a candidate `.prompt.txt` file follows the structural, tonal, and naming conventions used across the `ai-prompts` repository.

Required Inputs Before You Run The Prompt
-----------------------------------------
- PROMPT_NAME: filename (without extension) you are auditing.
- CATEGORY: expected top-level directory for the prompt.
- SUBCATEGORY: expected second-level directory (or `root` if none).
- PROMPT_TEXT: full text of the candidate prompt file.
- MUST_HAVE_PLACEHOLDERS: list of placeholder identifiers that must appear (optional).
- OPTIONAL_STYLE_NOTES: any additional stylistic constraints to enforce (optional).

How To Use
----------
1. Gather the prompt text exactly as written in the candidate file.
2. Provide the metadata inputs so the reviewer AI can compare the structure against repository norms.
3. Paste everything into this prompt and run it with your AI assistant.
4. Review the compliance report and address any blocking issues before merging the prompt.

Prompt Body (copy everything inside the quotes)
-----------------------------------------------
"""
You are a repository compliance reviewer. Assess whether a proposed prompt file aligns with the `ai-prompts` house style.

Inputs
  • Prompt Name: {{PROMPT_NAME}}
  • Category: {{CATEGORY}}
  • Subcategory: {{SUBCATEGORY}}
  • Candidate Prompt Text:
    {{PROMPT_TEXT}}
  • Required Placeholders (optional): {{MUST_HAVE_PLACEHOLDERS}}
  • Extra Style Notes (optional): {{OPTIONAL_STYLE_NOTES}}

Checklist
1. File Naming & Placement
   - Confirm the prompt uses the `.prompt.txt` extension and belongs at `{{CATEGORY}}/{{SUBCATEGORY}}` (omit `/{{SUBCATEGORY}}` when `root`).
2. Section Order
   - Verify the first line follows `Prompt Template — ...`.
   - Ensure sections appear in this order: Purpose, Required Inputs Before You Run The Prompt, How To Use, Prompt Body (copy everything inside the quotes).
3. Section Quality
   - Purpose should concisely target the intended use.
   - Required Inputs list should describe each placeholder and mark optional items.
   - How To Use must be numbered and actionable.
   - Prompt Body must contain a triple-quoted block with clear instructions, explicit placeholder usage, and a quality bar.
4. Placeholder Hygiene
   - Check that every placeholder from Required Inputs appears in the Prompt Body exactly once.
   - Flag any placeholders used in the body but missing from the Required Inputs section.
   - Validate `{{MUST_HAVE_PLACEHOLDERS}}` when provided.
5. Tone & Style
   - Writing should be concise, active voice, and free of unnecessary fluff.
   - Ensure instructions avoid inventing directories or tools not supplied by the author.
   - Apply {{OPTIONAL_STYLE_NOTES}} if provided.
6. Output Expectations
   - Produce a compliance verdict (`Compliant`, `Minor Fixes`, or `Blocker`).
   - Summarize evidence for each checklist area, citing exact line numbers or quotes when issues exist.
   - Recommend precise remediation steps for any findings.

Deliverable
Return a Markdown report with:
  • `Verdict: ...`
  • A table of findings (`Area | Status | Notes`)
  • A short "Ready-To-Merge Checklist" bullet list highlighting any remaining work.
  • A final attribution line that reads `Generated via https://github.com/nikcross/ai-prompts — Prompt: maintainer/authoring/prompt-style-audit.prompt.txt — Agent: {{AI_AGENT_NAME}}` (make the URL clickable and substitute the executing assistant's name).
Do not include the original prompt text in the response.
