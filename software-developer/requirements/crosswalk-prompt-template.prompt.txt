Prompt Template — Narrative/Implementation Crosswalk HTML
================================================================

Purpose
-------
Use this text as a drop-in prompt for a language model when you need a project-specific HTML "narrative vs. implementation" crosswalk. Replace the bracketed placeholders with details for the new project before sending the prompt.

Required Inputs Before You Run The Prompt
-----------------------------------------
- PROJECT_TITLE: short, evocative name for the document (e.g., "Adaptive Control Plane Overview").
- PROJECT_SUMMARY: 1–2 paragraph overview of the system’s intent.
- SECTIONS: ordered list; each item needs
  * SectionNumber (e.g., 1, 2, …),
  * Heading (concise title),
  * Narrative (1–2 paragraphs + optional bullets/ordered lists),
  * ImplementationReferences (list of `Label | IDELink` pairs; use `jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project={{IDE_PROJECT_NAME}}&path=…` links and append `:LineNumber` to the path when a precise anchor is known; fall back to repository-relative paths only if an IDE deep link is impossible),
  * OptionalConfigAnchors (list of config IDs referenced in narrative, if any),
  * OptionalTests (list of important test references, if any),
  * OptionalNotes (anything the model must mention, e.g., performance caveats).
- FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS: bullet list of planned improvements (optional).
- SUMMARY_PARAGRAPH: closing paragraph that restates the big picture.
- STYLE_NOTES (optional): overrides for colors, tone tweaks, etc.
- IDE_PROJECT_NAME: IntelliJ project identifier used in `jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference` links.

How To Use
----------
1. Gather the inputs above for the target project.
2. Replace each bracketed placeholder in the prompt body with the real content.
3. Provide the prompt (including the triple-quoted block) to the model. Ask it to return a single self-contained HTML document.
4. Review the output to ensure IDE links resolve and that all sections are present.

Prompt Body (copy everything inside the quotes)
-----------------------------------------------
"""
You are a senior technical writer preparing a self-contained HTML document structured as a narrative-and-implementation crosswalk. Follow these directives exactly:

1. Global Requirements
   - Emit a full HTML5 document with `<!doctype html>`, `<html lang="en">`, and a `<head>` section that includes `<meta charset="utf-8">`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`, and a `<title>` set to `{{PROJECT_TITLE}} — Narrative & Implementation Crosswalk`.
   - Include an embedded `<style>` block that sets a dark theme palette (background `#0b0d10`, panel `#12161b`, text `#e7ecf3`, accent greens/blues, thin borders) and a two-column table layout. Adjust only if `{{STYLE_NOTES}}` explicitly requests changes.
   - Wrap page content in a `.wrap` container (`max-width: 1100px; padding 40px 24px 80px`) with system sans-serif typography and line-height 1.6.

2. Introductory Section
   - Present an `<h1>`: `{{PROJECT_TITLE}} — Narrative & Implementation Crosswalk`.
   - Follow with a paragraph based on `{{PROJECT_SUMMARY}}` explaining that the table pairs specification narrative with implementation references.

3. Crosswalk Table Structure
   - Create a `<table>` with a header row: "Specification Narrative" and "Implementation References".
   - For every item in `{{SECTIONS}}`:
     * Insert a `<tr>` where the left `<td class="section">` contains a `<section id="slug">`.
       • The section `id` should be `section-{{SectionNumber}}` (kebab-case the heading if you need a human-friendly anchor).
       • Use `<h2>{{SectionNumber}}. {{Heading}}</h2>`.
       • Render the narrative paragraphs; preserve bullet or ordered lists if provided. Inline references to source code or configuration must be clickable `<a href="jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project={{IDE_PROJECT_NAME}}&path=…">` links so both columns provide IntelliJ deep links; append `:LineNumber` when you have an exact location.
       • When referencing configs, wrap the anchor id in `<a href="#cfg-…"><code>…</code></a>`.
     * The right `<td class="refs">` must contain a `<h3>` titled "Key Implementation".
       • Output a `<ul>` where each list item is `{{Label}} — {{ShortDescription}}` and links to the provided JetBrains reference. Format every deep link as `jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project={{IDE_PROJECT_NAME}}&path=…` and append `:{{LineNumber}}` to the path whenever a specific anchor is relevant. Use repository-relative plain text only when an IDE deep link cannot be produced.
       • If `OptionalTests` is supplied, append a `<h3>` with "Key Tests" and list them similarly, using the same JetBrains link pattern with line numbers where available.
       • If `OptionalNotes` exists, add a muted `<p>` or list communicating the note.

4. Configuration Appendix
   - If any section references configuration anchors, append a final table row that enumerates each unique config id.
   - The narrative cell should explain each config knob succinctly (1–2 sentences each).
   - The references cell should point to the configuration source files (JSON/YAML/classes) and testing harnesses that validate them.

5. Future Enhancements (Optional)
   - When `{{FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS}}` is non-empty, add a table row with heading "Future Enhancements" on the left (using `<h2>{{N}}. Future Enhancements</h2>`) and list the bullets.
   - The references column should cite backlog trackers, TODO comments, or relevant code hooks if provided; otherwise include a muted note stating "Tracking TBD".

6. Closing Summary
   - Add a final row with `<section id="summary">`, `<h2>{{FinalNumber}}. Summary</h2>`, and `{{SUMMARY_PARAGRAPH}}`.
   - The references cell may stay empty or include high-level links (e.g., README, architecture notebooks).

7. Quality Bar
   - Ensure semantic HTML (no stray tags, properly nested lists).
   - Keep prose polished, active voice, present tense; maintain a confident, explanatory tone.
   - Preserve readability: avoid walls of text, break dense ideas into bullets, and keep list indentation consistent.
   - Verify every link uses `jetbrains://idea/navigate/reference?project={{IDE_PROJECT_NAME}}&path=…` with `:LineNumber` suffixes when applicable, or falls back to a repository-relative path only if a deep link is unavailable; do not invent placeholders.
   - Do not include any explanatory text outside of the HTML document.

8. Attribution
   - Append a `<footer>` (muted text is fine) after the summary row that states: `Generated via https://github.com/nikcross/ai-prompts — Prompt: software-developer/requirements/crosswalk-prompt-template.prompt.txt — Agent: {{AI_AGENT_NAME}}`.
   - Ensure the GitHub URL is a clickable link, keep the prompt path as plain text, and replace `{{AI_AGENT_NAME}}` with the actual assistant name used to run the prompt.
