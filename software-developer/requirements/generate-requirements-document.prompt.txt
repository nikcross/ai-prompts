Prompt Template — Requirements Document HTML
===========================================

Purpose
-------
Use this prompt when you need a fresh product/feature requirements document rendered as a self-contained HTML page that matches the dark-theme aesthetic used by the other prompts in this directory.

Required Inputs Before You Run The Prompt
-----------------------------------------
- DOCUMENT_TITLE: terse, descriptive name for the requirements package.
- PROJECT_CONTEXT: 2–3 paragraphs capturing business problem, drivers, and current state constraints.
- OBJECTIVES: ordered list of measurable goals or success criteria.
- SCOPE: structure with two arrays: `InScope` and `OutOfScope` bullet lists.
- CAPABILITIES: ordered list; for each capability provide:
  * `ID` (e.g., REQ-001),
  * `Title`,
  * `Narrative` (2–3 paragraphs describing behaviour, edge cases, rationale),
  * `UserStories` (list of Given/When/Then or standard user stories),
  * `AcceptanceCriteria` (bullet list of verifiable checks),
  * `Dependencies` (list of other IDs or external systems),
  * `Priority` (MoSCoW or High/Med/Low),
  * `OpenQuestions` (optional list of unanswered items),
  * `Owner` (team or persona accountable for delivery).
- NON_FUNCTIONAL: list of performance, security, operability, and compliance requirements (each item should have a short name, description, and metric/threshold if applicable).
- DATA_CONSIDERATIONS: optional list describing storage, privacy, retention, or migration requirements.
- RISKS_AND_ASSUMPTIONS: list of risk entries with `Description`, `Impact`, `Mitigation`, and optional `Status`.
- TIMELINE: optional milestone list with target dates.
- REFERENCES: optional list of related documents/links for appendix.
- STYLE_NOTES (optional): palette or tone overrides.
- AI_AGENT_NAME: assistant identifier for attribution footer.

How To Use
----------
1. Gather the inputs above. Use triple-quoted blocks for any multi-paragraph fields when you substitute values.
2. Replace every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in the prompt body with your collected inputs.
3. Provide the entire prompt (including the quoted block) to the model.
4. Review the generated HTML for completeness and accuracy before publishing.

-----------------------------------------------
"""
You are a senior product requirements lead authoring a polished HTML requirements document. Follow the directives exactly.

Inputs
  • Title: {{DOCUMENT_TITLE}}
  • Project Context: {{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}
  • Objectives: {{OBJECTIVES}}
  • Scope: {{SCOPE}}
  • Capabilities: {{CAPABILITIES}}
  • Non-Functional Requirements: {{NON_FUNCTIONAL}}
  • Data Considerations: {{DATA_CONSIDERATIONS}}
  • Risks & Assumptions: {{RISKS_AND_ASSUMPTIONS}}
  • Timeline: {{TIMELINE}}
  • References: {{REFERENCES}}
  • Style Notes: {{STYLE_NOTES}}

Global Output Requirements
1. Emit a complete HTML5 document with `<!doctype html>`, `<html lang="en">`, `<head>` containing `<meta charset="utf-8">`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`, and `<title>{{DOCUMENT_TITLE}} — Requirements</title>`.
2. Embed a `<style>` block establishing the established dark theme palette (body background `#0b0d10`, panels `#12161b`, text `#e7ecf3`, accent greens/blues, subtle borders and drop shadows). Allow overrides only if `{{STYLE_NOTES}}` explicitly changes colors or typography.
3. Wrap main content in a centered `.wrap` (`max-width: 1100px; padding: 48px 32px 96px; font-family: "Segoe UI", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont`). Maintain line-height 1.65.

Document Structure
1. Cover Section
   - `<h1>{{DOCUMENT_TITLE}}</h1>` followed by a short tagline (derive from `{{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}`).
   - Add a two-column summary card: left column summarises context, right column lists key objectives as numbered badges.
2. Scope Section
   - Include `<section id="scope">` containing two cards: "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" bullet lists sourced from `{{SCOPE}}`.
3. Capability Requirements Matrix
   - For each entry in `{{CAPABILITIES}}`, render a card with:
     • Header `{{ID}} — {{Title}}` plus a pill showing `Priority`.
     • Narrative paragraphs.
     • Subheading "User Stories" with ordered or bulleted list using provided `UserStories` (preserve Given/When/Then formatting).
     • Subheading "Acceptance Criteria" with bullet list.
     • Compact meta-row listing `Owner`, `Dependencies` (link to other IDs using `#{{ID}}` anchors when they exist), and `Open Questions` (if provided, show as muted list; otherwise display "None").
     • Insert subtle horizontal rule between capability cards.
4. Non-Functional Section
   - Create a definition list or table enumerating `{{NON_FUNCTIONAL}}`, showing metric/thresholds in `<code>` or `<span class="metric">` styling.
   - If `{{DATA_CONSIDERATIONS}}` is provided, append a sub-section summarising each item (privacy classification, retention, encryption, etc.).
5. Risks & Assumptions
   - Render as a table with columns: ID (auto-numbered), Description, Impact, Mitigation, Status. Highlight rows with `Impact` containing "High" in accent red.
6. Timeline & Milestones (optional)
   - When `{{TIMELINE}}` is non-empty, build a horizontal timeline using flex cards with milestone title and target date.
7. References / Appendix (optional)
   - When `{{REFERENCES}}` exists, output a list of links or document titles under `<section id="references">`.
8. Closing Summary
   - End with a paragraph recapping the intent and reiterating success metrics. Encourage readers to align capability delivery with objectives.

Quality & Tone
- Use confident, active voice. Avoid fluff; emphasise clarity and verifiability.
- Preserve any markdown-style lists provided in inputs; convert them to semantic HTML lists when necessary.
- Validate inter-section anchors (`id="req-{{ID}}"`) so cross references work.
- Do not fabricate IDs or data beyond what inputs provide.

Attribution
- Append a `<footer>` stating: `Generated via https://github.com/nikcross/ai-prompts — Prompt: software-developer/requirements/generate-requirements-document.prompt.txt — Agent: {{AI_AGENT_NAME}}`. Make the GitHub URL clickable, keep the prompt path literal, and substitute the assistant name.

Return only the HTML document (no extra commentary).
